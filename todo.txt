STRT: implement cli threaded in and out in commlinklist
WAIT: take a CLI input and echo it back out

TODO: [A] make actual automatic configuration of comm mechanisms

STRT: [B] determine how to allow multiple channels to RX without interfering

TODO: make commlink keep track of both channel ends where applicable
TODO: figure out how unidirectional channels are handled programmatically


TODO: Allow some mechanism to group commlinks into a "redundancy group" where acks are required and if acks are not received, we waterfall down (rather than always sending on all available at once)
