TODO: [A] make actual automatic configuration of comm mechanisms
STRT: Get an actual RSS scrape/figure out scheduling params 

TODO: make commlink keep track of both channel ends where applicable
TODO: figure out how unidirectional channels are handled programmatically


TODO: keep track of "message pipelines" and which messages have been delivered and which have not. (store locally as needed)


TODO: Allow some mechanism to group commlinks into a "redundancy group" where acks are required and if acks are not received, we waterfall down (rather than always sending on all available at once)


DONE: implement cli threaded in and out in commlinklist
DONE: take a CLI input and echo it back out
DONE: [B] determine how to allow multiple channels to RX without interfering
